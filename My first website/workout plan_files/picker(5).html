I'm so excited to bring you this fun and new-style workout for my channel. Today, we will be performing a cardio workout routine using a jump rope. Don't panic! If you don't have a jump rope, you can just pretend and it will still be effective :) 

We are doing 20 seconds on with a 10-second rest. Repeating for 8 reps and doing 3 sets in total. At the end of the workout, we have a fun, short series of toning exercises to help tighten that entire body. 

I hope you all love this full-body routine!

Enjoy and make sure to comment after!
