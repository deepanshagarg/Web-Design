Like, why can't just a tiny bit go to the booty?? Well, I'm about to drop some knowledge on ya! It's not just what you eat that affects those levels of fat, it's also the amount of sleep you get AND how stressed you are feeling. Lack of sleep and stress can increase your cortisol hormone levels and oddly, that can contribute to an increase in lower belly fat. 

These five lower ab exercises are JUST what you need if you want to attack the lower belly pooch area (plus more sleep and less stress)!! They isolate your lower abdominals to really blast that belly fat! You can do this whole workout ANYWHERE, no weights required!!

1. Crunched heel taps x 1:30
2. Little U's x 1:30
3. Single leg drop x 1:30
4. Heel push abs x 1:30
5. Reverse double leg lift x 1:30

Workout starts at 1:42!

It's those two lines in the center of super chiseled abs, and that's what we're working toward in today's Total Body Transformation workout! This means targeting those middle abs and transverse abdominals.

Last week's weighted arm workout  inspired me to do something I've NEVER done before... a weighted ab routine!! Don't forget - this video can still be done without a weight or with any object you have laying around like a book or can of soup!

You have 8 ab moves today. We'll do each for 1 minute with a 15 second break in between. They are:

1. Twisting Crunch (R)
2. Twisting Crunch (L)
3. One Arm Roll Up (R)
4. One Arm Roll Up (L)
5. Boat Infinities
6. Twisting Side Plank (R)
7. Twisting Side Plank (L)
8. Shoulder Tap Plank

Workout starts at 2:23!

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: Some people may see my video titles as click-bait. YouTubers optimise their video's meta data for discovery due to how the algorithm is like. This isn't anything new. Most people who've been watching YouTube for years would understand this. If you're unhappy and get triggered by this, well, this channel isn't for you then. I’ve provided free workout schedules and programs since day 1 and have always optimised my meta data as such so that's not going to change.

Having said that, it doesn't mean the workout do not work. You will still see results by following a suitable program schedule, watching your diet, being in a deficit or surplus (based on your goals), doing exercises in good form, etc. These are all equally important factors. You're not going to get abs, grow a booty, grow biceps magically from 1 or 2 videos, in 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks cause everyone is different. A title may come close to suggesting that, but I've explain multiple times throughout videos throughout my channel over years that it takes time and lots of factors, so don't take a video title out of context. Targetting fat loss is also not scientifically proven. Everyone is different and it takes time. 

When doing any home workouts, do take precaution to exercise in a safe environment, and if you need help or you're not seeing results, I suggest seeing a health and fitness professional to give you tailored advice on your exercise form and dietary needs. I am not a medical professional and what I share on my channel are my views and what has worked for myself. Your health and safety is the utmost importance so find out what works for you.</div><div><span class="ve-kh-gf-yp">11 min - 20 May 2020</span></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class="ve-kh-gf" aria-labelledby=":2s" role="option" aria-checked="false" tabindex="-1" id=":2r" style="user-select: none;"><div class="ve-kh-gf-rb"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><div class="ve-kh-gf-nj"><div class="ve-kh-gf-O" aria-label="Press enter or click to play this video"><img src="./default(176).jpg" class="ve-kh-gf-O-x"><div class="ve-qj-kh-Bl-Xg a-b-c"></div></div></div></td><td width="100%" valign="top"><div class="ve-kh-gf-nn"><div class="ve-kh-gf-cb" id=":2s">How to get Flat Abs in 3 minutes!</div><div class="ve-kh-gf-eb ">This is a 3 min flat abs challenge to tighten your belly and harden your core!

If you're not a Beginner anymore, but the other videos are still a tiny bit too hard for you. This workout is for you! I hope I managed to find the perfect "in between" Level - a MEDIUM one. 
Have fun! :)

The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I’m doing 30s for each exercise. If you need a break - TAKE IT! Don't worry too much about that. You will improve over time :) that's the best feeling! 

I recommend switching up your workouts to give your muscles enough time to recover and to hit them from different angles. If you want to challenge your body in another way: check out my Live Workouts (with talking + explanations), the 20min Full Body Workouts, Leg Workouts or the Song Workouts. 

▸ you can find WORKOUT PLANS with those videos on my Instagram Channel. 30min, 45min and Beginner Friendly combinations. Check out the Highlight Bubble "Workout Plans" for that.
