I'm put together some of my favorite ab exercises full of POP Pilates flair and I promise you that you will BURN so good!

Make sure that when you are in Pilates Stance, your head, neck and shoulders are lifted off of the mat! Your head should really be just floating on top of your shoulders. It should not feel heavy if you're engaging your upper abs and pressing your lower back into the mat!

Remember, even if you're doing my workouts to achieve a flat belly or a six pack or Victoria's Secret model abs, the whole point of exercise is BEYOND the physical. When you do Blogilates, it's about how confident and happy you will feel! The flat abs are just a side benefit! Got it!? Love you!

I love how emotional this song is...and well, working the obliques and the muffin top can also be a very dramatic experience too! So, it felt like the perfect combo!

Just grab a mat and begin in plank position on your forearms. FYI this routine will not only work your waist, but it will also work your abs, your arms, your shoulders, and your back! Make sure your core is braced and your butt is not sticking up in the air! We'll begin with hip twists which are great for whittling down and strengthening your entire midriff area! Imagine a corset just getting tighter and tighter as you do more reps of these exercises!

Also just a note on working the love handles. I hope that when you're doing my videos that you're focused not just on losing weight, but more importantly on having fun! Because when you're enjoying the journey you're more likely to turn exercising into a healthy lifestyle that you can stick to. And that's the whole point! Working out should be something you look forward to! It doesn't have to be easy...it just has to be challenging in all the right ways!

Like, why can't just a tiny bit go to the booty?? Well, I'm about to drop some knowledge on ya! It's not just what you eat that affects those levels of fat, it's also the amount of sleep you get AND how stressed you are feeling. Lack of sleep and stress can increase your cortisol hormone levels and oddly, that can contribute to an increase in lower belly fat. 

These five lower ab exercises are JUST what you need if you want to attack the lower belly pooch area (plus more sleep and less stress)!! They isolate your lower abdominals to really blast that belly fat! You can do this whole workout ANYWHERE, no weights required!!

1. Crunched heel taps x 1:30
2. Little U's x 1:30
3. Single leg drop x 1:30
4. Heel push abs x 1:30
5. Reverse double leg lift x 1:30

Workout starts at 1:42!

This video is on how to get rid of a double chin, double chin exercises, lose a double chin and jawline exercises.

There are a number of reasons why we develop a double chin and they don’t all have to do with weight gain there’s loads of other factors too for example genetics, age and posture. In this weeks video were looking at how to reduce the appearance of a double chin.

Some of the messages I’ve had to make this video have been a little upsetting to read. So please remember don’t compare yourself to others I don’t think I’ve ever just randomly thought about someone's chin or jaw line. So don’t let it get to you, focus on your great qualities and always remember you’re awesome.

TREATMENT:
We have two options the first one is surgical treatments here is a brief explanation of the procedures available.

• Chin liposuction. This procedure removes excess fat from under the chin.
• Submentoplasty. This surgery combines chin liposuction and smaller incisions under the chin to tighten muscles.
• Neck lift. This surgery, called lower rhytidectomy, involves removing excess skin or tightening the neck skin muscles to give the face a more contoured appearance.

EXERCISE AND LIFESTYLE CHANGES:
The second option is lifestyle changes and exercises which I imagine will be of more interest to everyone.

So let’s first begin with the exercises, now the bad news is that there are no specific scientific studies to prove how effective these exercises are at reducing the appearance of a double chin. However anecdotally there is evidence supporting them.

Warm up:
Before starting warm up the area with some neck rotations slowly turning as far as is comfortable, hold this for 5 seconds and repeat 3 times on each side. 

Exercises:
The aim of the exercises are to strengthen and tone the muscles and skin between the neck and jaw. Aim to do these six exercises once a day.

1- To begin with tilt your head back and look towards the ceiling. Push your lower jaw forward to feel a stretch under the chin and hold this for 10 count. Next relax your jaw and return your head to a neutral position. Aim to do this 10 times.

2- Place a small ball or cylindrical object under your chin and press your chin against it. Repeat this 25 times.

3- Tilt your head back and look at the ceiling. Pucker your lips as if you're kissing the ceiling 15 times and make sure you get a good stretch in the area beneath the chin. Once your done bring your head back to it’s normal position.

4- Tongue stretch, look straight ahead, stick your tongue out as far as you can and lift it upwards towards nose. Try and hold this for 10 seconds then release and repeat 10 times.

5- Tilt your head back and look at the ceiling. Press your tongue against the roof of your mouth. Hold this for 5-10 seconds then release and repeat 10 times.

6- Tilt your head back and look at the ceiling. Next turn your head to the right and slide your bottom jaw forward. Hold this for 5-10 seconds and repeat 5 times on the right side and 5 times on the left.

Body Mass Index:
Check your weight status using the following BMI calculator: https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/healthy-weight/bmi-calculator/

If you are overweight the good news I did make a video not long ago with a detailed guide on how to lose weight: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wn8BNJEQ05w

You should also be exercising regularly so it’s a 150 minutes of moderate intensity exercise per week or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity exercise per week.

RESULTS:
Let us know how you get on with the exercises maybe leave a comment and we can see how effective they are like our own little experiment, I’ll also begin giving them a go and maybe do an update video in the future.
