If there’s air in the bottle, the water will move from side to side - which is a little annoying. / Werbung

I know, training Booty &amp; Abs is our favorite. But don’t neglect your arms! Toned arms, that fit to the rest of your beautiful body. Strong arms, that have enough strength to hold you during a Plank Workouts (haha!). 
No huge, masculine biceps - but also no flabby bingo wings. This workout will NOT make your arm muscles grow big + bulky. It will just make them more defined :) This is a super fun routine, which seems easy at first .. but it will make your arms BURN, I promise.

Aaaand I also love the music in this video. Feeling the burn is definitely easier when we can sing along!

Tone your biceps, triceps, shoulders and back muscles in this fun but intense and SUPER EFFECTIVE Toned Arms Workout. If you don't have dumbbells at home you can fill up two water bottles (preferably 1L each) and use these for additional resistance to still help you achieve lean arms.
-
The primary goal of this workout is to help you build lean muscle and burn excess fat. To lose fat fast and in turn lose arm fat pay close attention to the type of food you consume, your protein levels, water intake, your rest/sleep and do more cardio focused workouts. 
All of the Mr and Mrs Muscle Workouts are high intensity cardio based and designed for faster fat loss.

*Please take note that calories burned vary for every individual depending on multiple factors (e.g. age, body weight, heart rate, height, effort intensity, etc). Any slight variation in any of these factors can dramatically alter the amount of calories you burn. I calculate all of my calories using an Apple Watch 3 with the High Intensity Interval Training Workout application and I am 28 years old, 5’8”, and weigh 145lbs so you can use my few factors as well as my intensity level to gauge yourself.
