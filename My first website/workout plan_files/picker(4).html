Like, why can't just a tiny bit go to the booty?? Well, I'm about to drop some knowledge on ya! It's not just what you eat that affects those levels of fat, it's also the amount of sleep you get AND how stressed you are feeling. Lack of sleep and stress can increase your cortisol hormone levels and oddly, that can contribute to an increase in lower belly fat. 

These five lower ab exercises are JUST what you need if you want to attack the lower belly pooch area (plus more sleep and less stress)!! They isolate your lower abdominals to really blast that belly fat! You can do this whole workout ANYWHERE, no weights required!!

1. Crunched heel taps x 1:30
2. Little U's x 1:30
3. Single leg drop x 1:30
4. Heel push abs x 1:30
5. Reverse double leg lift x 1:30

Workout starts at 1:42!

It's those two lines in the center of super chiseled abs, and that's what we're working toward in today's Total Body Transformation workout! This means targeting those middle abs and transverse abdominals.

Last week's weighted arm workout  inspired me to do something I've NEVER done before... a weighted ab routine!! Don't forget - this video can still be done without a weight or with any object you have laying around like a book or can of soup!

You have 8 ab moves today. We'll do each for 1 minute with a 15 second break in between. They are:

1. Twisting Crunch (R)
2. Twisting Crunch (L)
3. One Arm Roll Up (R)
4. One Arm Roll Up (L)
5. Boat Infinities
6. Twisting Side Plank (R)
7. Twisting Side Plank (L)
8. Shoulder Tap Plank

Workout starts at 2:23!

You see, the core is generally made up of four key components. Namely - the rectus abdominus (6pack / lower abs), obliques, the serratus anterior, and the transverse abdominus (inner abs).

The obliques are an absolute must when it comes to developing an aesthetic physique. If your goal is to attain the V tapered look, there’s no way around training them. The obliques are a multifunctional muscle, they act to pull the chest downwards and compress the abdominal cavity, as well as performing side bending and opposing side rotation. Overall, you can’t skimp on your obliques for aesthetic and performance, and the best way to ensure that you stay on track is to keep your workouts fresh &amp; challenging

The serratus is a muscle that originates on your upper rib cage and attaches to the media border of the shoulder blade (basically the shark gill looking things). The serratus muscles play a pivotal role in framing out your abs, obliques and lower pec. Not too mention, it absolutely serves as an asset to the v taper, in turn giving you a better looking set of abs!

This video is full length which means you can just follow along with whatever I'm doing. If you need extra rest, just pause the video. If you don't need a rest - watch it the whole way through.

You can hit this home workout 2-3x per week - and if you wanted to keep active on your other days - be sure to check out my other workouts!

The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I’m doing 30s for each exercise. If you need a break - TAKE IT! Don't worry too much about that. You will improve over time :) that's the best feeling! 

I recommend switching up your workouts to give your muscles enough time to recover and to hit them from different angles. If you want to challenge your body in another way: check out my Live Workouts (with talking + explanations), the 20min Full Body Workouts, Leg Workouts or the Song Workouts.

Guys, this is a hard core routine that will sculpt, tone, and tighten your upper abs, lower abs, midsection, and overall core. I'm put together some of my favorite ab exercises full of POP Pilates flair and I promise you that you will BURN so good!

Make sure that when you are in Pilates Stance, your head, neck and shoulders are lifted off of the mat! Your head should really be just floating on top of your shoulders. It should not feel heavy if you're engaging your upper abs and pressing your lower back into the mat!

Remember, even if you're doing my workouts to achieve a flat belly or a six pack or Victoria's Secret model abs, the whole point of exercise is BEYOND the physical. When you do Blogilates, it's about how confident and happy you will feel! The flat abs are just a side benefit! Got it!? Love you!

A very intense sequence of exercises working your: abs, core strength, arms &amp; back muscles, chest, glutes, inner and outer thighs and your CARDIO. So all in all a great way to fire up your entire body in 15min ♥︎

I know a lot of those movements are very challenging - if you need a break - take it! You will get better over time :) 
Another option is performing the exercise without the chair (and for example) placing your feet on the ground. You do you! ♥︎

The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I’m doing 30s for each exercise. There is one 1min rests in between. 

I recommend switching up your workouts to give your muscles enough time to recover and to hit them from different angles. You can do this workout 2-3x a week and if you want to do be active on the other days: check out my Sixpack, Muffin Top, Sexy Arms, Calorie Burn or Booty Workout!!
