I included moves that we've done before like Walnut Crushers and Prayer Pulses, but I wanted to keep things fresh for you and added brand new POP Pilates moves to keep your muscles guessing!

The moves are:
1. Pull Backs
2. Shoulder Presses
3. Kneeling Triceps
4. Walnut Crushers
5. Prayer Pulses

Oh man, the Back Pulls and Kneeling Triceps look easy, but your arms will be on fire! There is little rest between exercises, lots of reps and pulses, so the burn is REAL. You will get stronger and get an amazing arm pump after finishing this workout. I know you can do it! Stay strong! Ready? Let's do it!

We collaborated on some new and never before seen weightless arm exercises that are sure to burn your shoulders, your BICEPS (which is so hard to work without weights), and your chest. Seriously guys, these arm toning exercises are NO JOKE. Probably one of the harder weightless arm series I've done! See if you can last!

If for whatever reason you're a workout maniac and want to make this harder, try holding light weights in your hands! But honestly you won't need to if you're engaging your muscles and holding the proper form. Be sure to sit tall and put all your energy into your upper body. Do you best not to stop! The more your train your mind to be strong, the tougher your body and your endurance will be!

So gonna let you in on a little secret...my wedding dress is actually going to backless! But that is all I will tell you! But because of this, I made sure to make us the BEST backless dress workout that was ever created!

The great thing about working your back is that it will improve your posture, make you look taller, and also look more confident! It's a win for you big time. Lucky for you, there is no equipment, you don't need a gym, and you can do this workout anywhere! But especially at home :) Have fun!

Every workout in the Blogilates Bridal Bootcamp is 10 minutes long with NO BREAKS. There are 10 moves that are done for 1 minute each, back to back. I'm training you this way to save you time while teaching your muscles to get stronger with intense moves in a very short amount of time. 

The 10 cardio exercises for your Bridal Bootcamp are:

1. Walnut Crushers
2. Goal Post Puncher
3. Reverse Plank Lifts
4. Bird Dog Pulses R
5. Bird Dog Pulses L
6. Parachuters
7. Half Cobra Grasshopper
8. Snow Angel Belly
9. Flying Bird Dog R
10. Flying Bird Dog L

If you are starting to do some of your own wedding planning, I recommend you check out http://www.TheKnot.com. You can create your own wedding website for free as well as search for great vendors in your area.
