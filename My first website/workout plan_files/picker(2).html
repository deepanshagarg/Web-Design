Does it work?


Here is the workout link https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTa6crp6L9g&amp;t=611s


I am a mother of two and currently making busy book part time. To be honest i don’t really like workout, but i have to do it to get back in shape.

I kept complaining about how i hated the way my tummy looked, but  complaining would not change anything so here i am working my butt off.

I like experimenting with exercises and finding what is right for me. Losing weight and being healthy for myself not somebody else.

I need workout that is effective and quick. Definitely can’t go to gym and no diet or eating less! I encourage you to find the suitable workout for you. I am an impatient person so i choose fast paced workout.

Keep an open mind that every person is different, if there were no result then you should not be discouraged but moved on to next workout.

You see, the core is generally made up of four key components. Namely - the rectus abdominus (6pack / lower abs), obliques, the serratus anterior, and the transverse abdominus (inner abs).

The obliques are an absolute must when it comes to developing an aesthetic physique. If your goal is to attain the V tapered look, there’s no way around training them. The obliques are a multifunctional muscle, they act to pull the chest downwards and compress the abdominal cavity, as well as performing side bending and opposing side rotation. Overall, you can’t skimp on your obliques for aesthetic and performance, and the best way to ensure that you stay on track is to keep your workouts fresh &amp; challenging

The serratus is a muscle that originates on your upper rib cage and attaches to the media border of the shoulder blade (basically the shark gill looking things). The serratus muscles play a pivotal role in framing out your abs, obliques and lower pec. Not too mention, it absolutely serves as an asset to the v taper, in turn giving you a better looking set of abs!

This video is full length which means you can just follow along with whatever I'm doing. If you need extra rest, just pause the video. If you don't need a rest - watch it the whole way through.

You can hit this home workout 2-3x per week - and if you wanted to keep active on your other days - be sure to check out my other workouts!

12-Minute Standing Abs Workout

1. Standing dumbbell crunch
2. Rotating dumbbell crunch
3. Rotating curtsy lunge
4. Standing oblique side bend
5. Plie squat and twist
6. Curtsy overhead bends
7. Wood chops
8. Plie side bend crunch

Looking for a great way to intensify your ab workouts and take your core to the next level? There are two sure-fire ways to do it...

Try some new exercises and add weight!

All-too-often we think "ab workouts" need to entail a million sit ups and crunches to yield toned and fit results. Not true!

I encourage clients and patients all the time to get up off the floor and try something new. It's actually a more functional way to train your core, can be easier on your back and neck, and yield amazing results.

Today I'm sharing with you eight of my favorite standing abs exercises compiled in one awesome core workout you can do right from home.

All you need for this workout is one dumbbell (or any type of resistance - even a big water bottle would do!) and you will be feeling this in no time!

No weights at home or weights too difficult? No problem - just do it without the weight. I've got beginner as well as advanced versions of each exercise demonstrated in the video below.

Bonus: NO CRUNCHES REQUIRED! You will be standing the entire workout!

THE WORKOUT

For this workout, we'll perform 8 exercises in 50/10 intervals. That means you'll do 50 seconds of work followed by 10 seconds of an active rest/recovery. These exercises are ordered in such a way that we're going to work all of our core muscles through all their planes of motion, and we're going to do it non-stop.

So grab your timer, and let's get to work!

12-MINUTE STANDING ABS WORKOUT

1. Standing dumbbell crunch - 50 seconds on, 10 seconds off
- Stand holding your dumbbell in both hands over your head.
- March your left knee up to hip level while crunching your elbows down towards your knee.
- Return to the starting position and then repeat with the right knee

2. Rotating dumbbell crunch - 50 seconds on, 10 seconds off
- Stand holding your dumbbell in both hands over your head
- March your left knee up to hip level and angled towards your right shoulder.
- Crunch your elbows down at an angle so your right elbow goes to your left knee.
- Return to the starting position and then repeat with the right knee

3. Rotating curtsy lunge - 50 seconds on, 10 seconds off&nbsp;(1 minute right, 1 minute left)
- Hold the weight out straight in front of you.
- Perform a curtsy lunge by dropping your right foot back behind you and to the outside of your left foot.
- Rotate your torso/the dumbbell as far as you can to the left.
- Return to the upright starting position.

4. Standing oblique side bend&nbsp;- 50 seconds on, 10 seconds off&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 minute right, 1 minute left)
- Hold the weight in your right hand, place your left hand behind your head, and bend as far as you can to the right.
- Perform an oblique crunch by raising your right shoulder as high as you can to the ceiling and bend over to the left.
- BONUS - bring your left knee up towards your left elbow while performing the crunch.

5. Plie squat and twist&nbsp;- 50 seconds on, 10 seconds off
- Start down in a plie squat with your weight straight out in front of you.
- Come up out of your plie squat and rotate to your left.
- Return back down into the plie squat and repeat to the right.

6. Curtsy overhead bends&nbsp;- 50 seconds on, 10 seconds off&nbsp;(1 minute right, 1 minute left)
- Stand upright with the weight over your head.
- Drop into a curtsy lunge on your left leg by dropping your right leg back behind you with your right foot outside of your left.
- As you perform the curtsy lunge side bend to the left to elongate your right obliques as much as possible.

7. Wood chops&nbsp;- 50 seconds on, 10 seconds off&nbsp;(1 minute right, 1 minute left)
- Start with the dumbbell at your left knee.
- With both hands raise the dumbbell up and over your head to the right.
- Slowly return to the starting position.

8. Plie side bend crunch&nbsp;- 50 seconds on, 10 seconds off
- Drop into a plie squat position with a dumbbell raised over your head.
- Hold your plie as you sidebend as much as possible to the left. Use the muscles on your right side to pull yourself back to upright.
- Repeat by dropping as far as possible to the right.

THERE YOU GO! I hope you enjoyed this easy, 12-minute abs workout with weights!

I'm talking about that tiny bit of wobble that creates a fat roll if you put on a pair of skinny jeans. This workout trains your entire abs - but with focus on OBLIQUES! If you want to make this part stronger - take 10 minutes and give this workout a GO! ♥︎ no talking, just TRAIN :) 

No Equipment or weights needed! 

The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I’m doing 30s for each exercise – NO REST IN BETWEEN.


I recommend switching up your workouts to give your muscles enough time to recover. You can do this workout 2-3x a week and if you want to do be active on the other days: check out my Calorie Burn, Whole Body, 2in1, Arm or Booty Workout ♥︎

#abs #homeworkout #chloeting

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: Some people may see my video titles as click-bait. YouTubers optimise their video's meta data for discovery due to how the algorithm is like. This isn't anything new. Most people who've been watching YouTube for years would understand this. If you're unhappy and get triggered by this, well, this channel isn't for you then. I’ve provided free workout schedules and programs since day 1 and have always optimised my meta data as such so that's not going to change.

Having said that, it doesn't mean the workout do not work. You will still see results by following a suitable program schedule, watching your diet, being in a deficit or surplus (based on your goals), doing exercises in good form, etc. These are all equally important factors. You're not going to get abs, grow a booty, grow biceps magically from 1 or 2 videos, in 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks cause everyone is different. A title may come close to suggesting that, but I've explain multiple times throughout videos throughout my channel over years that it takes time and lots of factors, so don't take a video title out of context. Targetting fat loss is also not scientifically proven. Everyone is different and it takes time. 

When doing any home workouts, do take precaution to exercise in a safe environment, and if you need help or you're not seeing results, I suggest seeing a health and fitness professional to give you tailored advice on your exercise form and dietary needs. I am not a medical professional and what I share on my channel are my views and what has worked for myself. Your health and safety is the utmost importance so find out what works for you.</div><div><span class="ve-kh-gf-yp">11 min - 20 May 2020</span></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><div class="ve-kh-gf" aria-labelledby=":2b" role="option" aria-checked="false" tabindex="-1" id=":2a" style="user-select: none;"><div class="ve-kh-gf-rb"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><div class="ve-kh-gf-nj"><div class="ve-kh-gf-O" aria-label="Press enter or click to play this video"><img src="./default(114).jpg" class="ve-kh-gf-O-x"><div class="ve-qj-kh-Bl-Xg a-b-c"></div></div></div></td><td width="100%" valign="top"><div class="ve-kh-gf-nn"><div class="ve-kh-gf-cb" id=":2b">10 MIN TONED ARMS - quick &amp; intense at home / with water bottles I Pamela Reif</div><div class="ve-kh-gf-eb ">TIP: fill up your bottles as FULL AS POSSIBLE. If there’s air in the bottle, the water will move from side to side - which is a little annoying. / Werbung

I know, training Booty &amp; Abs is our favorite. But don’t neglect your arms! Toned arms, that fit to the rest of your beautiful body. Strong arms, that have enough strength to hold you during a Plank Workouts (haha!). 
No huge, masculine biceps - but also no flabby bingo wings. This workout will NOT make your arm muscles grow big + bulky. It will just make them more defined :) This is a super fun routine, which seems easy at first .. but it will make your arms BURN, I promise.

Aaaand I also love the music in this video. Feeling the burn is definitely easier when we can sing along!

Today’s workout is a standing Arms &amp; Abs Series. I absolutely LOVE performing standing Arms &amp; Abs, because we’re working a multitude of muscle groups all at one time &amp; having a blast while doing so! I’ll be using 3 lb weights for this series, but feel free to use 1 or 2 lbs weights to modify or no weights at all; you’re still going to feel a major burn. Now let’s get sculpting!
