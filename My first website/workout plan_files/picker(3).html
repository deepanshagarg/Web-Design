Remember to go as hard as you can for 45 seconds before your 15 second rest on each move!! I wanna see you guys shake!! Do 4 rounds for a total 28 minute workout.

1. Fast squats
2. Hip twists
3. Alternating front lunge
4. Leg outs
5. Single legged squat &amp; lift
6. Push up ankle tap
7. Plié punches

The Man</div><div class="ve-kh-gf-eb ">My sister's fave song of the moment is "Feel it Still" by Portugal The Man so I wanted to do a workout challenge duet with her for our arms! We collaborated on some new and never before seen weightless arm exercises that are sure to burn your shoulders, your BICEPS (which is so hard to work without weights), and your chest. Seriously guys, these arm toning exercises are NO JOKE. Probably one of the harder weightless arm series I've done! See if you can last!

If for whatever reason you're a workout maniac and want to make this harder, try holding light weights in your hands! But honestly you won't need to if you're engaging your muscles and holding the proper form. Be sure to sit tall and put all your energy into your upper body. Do you best not to stop! The more your train your mind to be strong, the tougher your body and your endurance will be!
